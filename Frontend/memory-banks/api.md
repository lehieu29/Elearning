# Module: API (pages/api/)

## Purpose
The `pages/api/` directory contains backend API routes for the application, enabling server-side functionality such as authentication and data handling. These routes are part of Next.js's API capabilities.

## Structure & Logic
1. **Authentication**:
   - **`auth/[...nextauth].ts`**: Implements authentication using NextAuth.js. Supports multiple authentication providers and session management.

## Related Files
- **`auth/[...nextauth].ts`**: Core file for handling authentication logic.

## Notes
- The API routes are minimal, focusing primarily on authentication.
- NextAuth.js simplifies the integration of authentication providers and session handling.
